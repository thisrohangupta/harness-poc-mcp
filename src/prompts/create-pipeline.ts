Steps:
1. Read the pipeline JSON Schema resource (schema:///pipeline) to understand the required pipeline structure and fields
2. Call harness_describe with resource_type="pipeline" to understand available operations
3. If helpful, call harness_list with resource_type="pipeline"${projectId ? ` and project_id="${projectId}"` : ""} to see existing pipeline patterns
4. Also check available connectors (harness_list resource_type="connector"), services (harness_list resource_type="service"), and environments (harness_list resource_type="environment")
5. Generate the pipeline YAML conforming to the schema
6. Present the YAML for review before creating

Do NOT create the pipeline until I confirm — just show me the YAML first.`,
