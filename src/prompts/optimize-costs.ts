Steps:
1. Call harness_list with resource_type="cost_recommendation"${projectId ? ` and project_id="${projectId}"` : ""} to get current cost recommendations
2. Call harness_list with resource_type="cost_anomaly"${projectId ? ` and project_id="${projectId}"` : ""} to identify any cost anomalies
3. Prioritize findings by potential savings (highest first)
4. For each recommendation, provide:
   - **What**: Which resource/service is over-provisioned or idle
   - **Savings**: Estimated monthly savings
   - **Action**: Specific steps to realize the savings
   - **Risk**: Any potential impact of making the change

Present a summary table of top recommendations sorted by savings potential, then detailed breakdowns.`,
