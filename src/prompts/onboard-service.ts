          text: `Onboard the service "${serviceName}" into Harness with a complete deployment setup.

Steps:
1. **Check existing**: Call harness_search with query="${serviceName}"${projectId ? ` and project_id="${projectId}"` : ""} to see if this service already exists
2. **Review patterns**: Call harness_list with resource_type="service"${projectId ? ` and project_id="${projectId}"` : ""} to see existing service patterns in the project
3. **Environments**: Call harness_list with resource_type="environment"${projectId ? ` and project_id="${projectId}"` : ""} to see available environments
4. **Connectors**: Call harness_list with resource_type="connector"${projectId ? ` and project_id="${projectId}"` : ""} to see available infrastructure connectors
5. **Create service**: Generate the service YAML definition following existing patterns
6. **Create pipeline**: Generate a deployment pipeline YAML for the service with:
   - Build stage (if applicable)
   - Deploy to dev/staging/prod environments
   - Approval gates between staging and prod
7. **Present for review**: Show all generated YAML before creating anything

Do NOT create any resources until I confirm — present the complete plan first with all YAML definitions.`,
