# Harness MCP Server — Gemini CLI Context

This extension connects Gemini CLI to the Harness Platform through 10 consolidated MCP tools that cover 111 resource types across 24 toolsets.

## How This Server Works

Unlike traditional MCP servers with one tool per API endpoint, this server uses a **registry-based dispatch** pattern. You interact through generic verb-based tools and specify the `resource_type` you want to work with.

**Start with discovery:**
- `harness_describe` — Browse all available resource types (no API call, instant)
- `harness_describe` with `search_term` — Find resource types by keyword
- `harness_describe` with `resource_type` — Get full detail on a specific type

**Then use CRUD tools:**
- `harness_list` — List resources with filtering and pagination
- `harness_get` — Get a single resource by ID
- `harness_create` — Create a resource (requires `confirmation: true`)
- `harness_update` — Update a resource (requires `confirmation: true`)
- `harness_delete` — Delete a resource (requires `confirmation: true`)

**Specialized tools:**
- `harness_execute` — Run pipelines, toggle feature flags, test connectors, sync GitOps apps
- `harness_search` — Search across multiple resource types at once
- `harness_diagnose` — Aggregate execution details, pipeline YAML, and logs for failure analysis
- `harness_status` — Project health overview: failed, running, and recent executions

## Example Queries

Ask natural language questions like:

- "What's happening in my project right now?"
- "Show me the latest pipeline executions"
- "Why did the deploy-to-prod pipeline fail?"
- "List all services in my project"
- "Find anything related to cost recommendations"
- "Run the nightly-build pipeline with tag v2.1.0"
- "Toggle the dark-mode feature flag on in production"
- "What connectors are available?"
- "Show me critical security issues"
- "List chaos experiments"
- "What GitOps applications are deployed?"
- "Who has admin access?"

## Safety Model

Write operations (`harness_create`, `harness_update`, `harness_delete`, `harness_execute`) all require `confirmation: true`. The server will preview available actions and return helpful context when `confirmation: false`, then only proceed when explicitly confirmed.

Secret values are never exposed — only metadata (name, type, scope).

## Setup

1. **Get your Harness API Key:**
   - Go to Harness Platform > Account Settings > Access Management > API Keys
   - Create a new API key with appropriate permissions

2. **Configure environment variables** in the project's `.env` file:
   ```
   HARNESS_API_KEY=pat.xxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxx
   HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
   HARNESS_DEFAULT_ORG_ID=default
   HARNESS_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=your_project
   ```

3. **Build the server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install && pnpm build
   ```

4. **Test it:**
   Ask: "List my pipelines" or "What's happening in my project?"

**If you get authentication errors:**
- Verify your API key: check `.env` file has `HARNESS_API_KEY` set
- Confirm the API key has proper permissions in Harness Platform
- For self-managed Harness, set `HARNESS_BASE_URL` in `.env`

**Toolset filtering:**
- Set `HARNESS_TOOLSETS=pipelines,services,connectors` in `.env` to limit which resource types are available
- Leave empty to enable all 24 toolsets
